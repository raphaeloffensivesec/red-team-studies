# TryHackMe - Introduction to Pentesting

## Overview
This section of the **Jr Penetration Tester** path introduces the fundamentals of penetration testing, covering the typical methodology, phases of an engagement, and common tools. Below is my documentation of what I learned and practiced.

## 1. What is Penetration Testing?
Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is the process of simulating attacks on systems, applications, or networks to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.  
It helps organizations strengthen security by discovering weaknesses under controlled conditions.

### Goals of Pentesting:
- Identify security flaws and misconfigurations.  
- Evaluate the effectiveness of defensive measures.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to mitigate risks.

## 2. Phases of a Penetration Test

### 2.1. Planning and Scoping
- Define the rules of engagement (ROE).  
- Establish testing boundaries (IP ranges, applications, systems).  
- Set objectives (black-box, white-box, or grey-box).  

### 2.2. Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)
- **Passive Recon:** Collect data without interacting directly with the target (e.g., Google dorking, WHOIS, OSINT).  
- **Active Recon:** Actively probe the target (e.g., port scanning, service enumeration).  

### 2.3. Enumeration and Scanning
- Use tools like **Nmap** to identify open ports and services.  
- Detect operating systems and versions.  
- Find possible attack surfaces.  

Example:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap.txt <target-ip>
```
### 2.4. Exploitation
- Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
- May involve:
-  SQL Injection (manipulating database queries).
-  XSS (injecting malicious scripts into web apps).
-  Command Injection (executing system commands).
-  Weak credentials (default or guessable logins).
-  File upload vulnerabilities (uploading web shells).
- Goal: Gain initial access to the target system.

### 2.5. Privilege Escalation

- Escalate from a low-privileged user to higher privileges.
- Methods include:
- Exploiting SUID binaries.
- Abusing cron jobs.
- Leveraging misconfigured permissions.
- Using kernel exploits.

### 2.6. Post-Exploitation
- Establish persistence (scheduled tasks, SSH keys).
- Extract sensitive data (flags, credentials, tokens).
- Demonstrate the potential impact without causing real damage.

### 2.7. Reporting
- Document all steps taken.
- Provide vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, and remediation advice.
- Reports must be professional, clear, and reproducible.

### 3. Tools Introduced
Some of the main tools used in this section:
- **Nmap** – for scanning and service enumeration.
- **Gobuster / Dirb** – for directory and file brute forcing.
- **Nikto** – for web vulnerability scanning.
- **Metasploit** – framework for automated exploitation.
- **Burp Suite** – for web traffic interception and testing.

### 4. Key Concepts Learned
- Pentesting follows a structured methodology (like the PTES or OSSTMM frameworks).
- Not every test focuses only on exploitation — planning and reporting are equally critical.
- The distinction between recon, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation is essential for a professional workflow.

### 5. Lessons Learned
- Systematic methodology is the backbone of professional pentesting.
- Enumeration often reveals more than direct exploitation attempts.
- Documentation is as important as technical skill, especially for client reporting.
